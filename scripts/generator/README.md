# rocFFT kernel runner

The `run-generated` script can be used to run kernels generated by the
rocFFT kernel generator.  This serves as a development tool to explore
the performance of generated kernels.

Please see `run-generated --help` for usage information.  Briefly

    ./run-generated 8 8

will generate a length 64 C2C kernel (in
`stockham_generated_kernel.h`) and run it (see `stockham.cpp`).
